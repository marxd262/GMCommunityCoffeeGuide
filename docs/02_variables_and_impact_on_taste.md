# 2. Overview of the variables

Directly controllable

- Bean choice – origin, roast level, freshness
- Dose (amount of ground coffee) – determines bed depth and resistance
- Grind size – affects flow resistance and extraction speed
- Target yield (output volume) – defines brew ratio together with dose
- Brew temperature – influences solubility of flavor compounds
- Basket diameter – changes bed geometry and pressure distribution

Indirectly influenced (result of the above)

- Flow rate – the speed at which water moves through the puck
- Brew ratio – dose ÷ yield, a key metric for balancing extraction
- Pressure – generated by the pump; affected by grind, dose, and basket size
- Extraction time – total time water contacts the coffee, derived from flow and pressure

# 3. Variables before Extraction

These are the variables that get decided before we even start the extraction.

## 3.1. Bean choice

- Roast level: Light roasts are denser, so they need a finer grind, higher brew temperature, or more pressure to achieve proper extraction. Dark roasts are more porous and extract more readily, allowing a slightly coarser grind or lower pressure. Adjust your extraction variables accordingly.
- Freshness: After roasting, beans retain CO₂-especially darker roasts. Allow ~7‑10 days for degassing before brewing. As beans age, volatile aromatics dissipate and the coffee becomes harder to extract, so you may need to fine‑tune grind size, dose, temperature, or pressure to maintain flavor balance. Use beans within the first two months of the roast date for optimal results. That doesn't mean you should throw away older beans.

## 3.2. Amount of ground coffee (dose) 

Increasing the dose adds more soluble compounds for the water to extract and creates a deeper puck. The greater bed depth raises the puck’s resistance, slowing flow and extending extraction time. Adjustments in other areas like yield, grind size and so on will be needed.

## 3.3. Bed depth

Bed depth is set by dose and basket size; a deeper puck raises hydraulic resistance, so you typically coarsen the grind (or lower the dose) to maintain flow. A smaller‑diameter basket (stepdown basket) can keep the same grind size only if the dose is reduced.

## 3.4. Grindsize

Grindsize is probably the best known variable, because for a lot of machines it's one of the only variables that can be changed.  
  
Grind size controls resistance and therefore extraction: finer → higher extraction, coarser → lower extraction. 

One more or less important factor: Grind size not only sets extraction level but also determines the uniformity of the particle distribution. Finer grinds extract faster but produce a broader range of particle sizes, mixing fast‑extracting fines with slow‑extracting larger particles and blurring flavor clarity. Since all grinders inherently generate some size variance, opting for a modestly coarser grind (which narrows the distribution) can give the clearest, most defined cup - assuming the rest of the brew parameters are adjusted to maintain adequate extraction. A coarser grind size could be achieved with a higher beddepth which could be achieved through a stepdown basket (lower diameter) or using a higher dose.

# 4. Variables during a shot

This are variables that get set through the profile or other 

## 4.1. Yield

Yield (output volume) has the greatest influence on espresso taste. A higher yield-more water passing through the puck-extracts more bitter and sweet solubles, reducing the perceived sourness. Conversely, a lower yield emphasizes acidity.

## 4.2. Ratio

Ratio describes the relationship between dose and yield. The Ratio impacts the concentration and mouthfeel. Lower ratio (e.g., 1 : 1.5) → higher concentration → richer, heavier body and more pronounced mouthfeel.

Higher ratio (e.g., 1 : 2.5) → lower concentration → lighter texture and a more delicate mouthfeel.

## 4.3. Temperature

Water temperature is the primary driver of solvent power. Higher brew temperatures increase extraction, while lower temperatures reduce it. As a rule of thumb, begin with:

- Dark roasts: 88 °C – 90 °C
- Medium roasts: 90 °C – 92 °C
- Light roasts: 92 °C – 96 °C

Then adjust up or down in small increments (±1 °C) until the desired balance of acidity, sweetness, and body is achieved for the specific bean.

## 4.4. Pressure

Higher brew pressure drives water deeper into the coffee puck, extracting more solubles. Excessive early pressure can over‑compact the puck, raising pressure later in the shot.

Pressure is the product of flow rate and puck resistance (dose, grind, basket size).

## 4.5. Flow

Fast flow → short contact time → lower overall extraction (brighter, more acidic, less bitter).

Slow flow → long contact time → higher extraction (richer body, more bitterness).
