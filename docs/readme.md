# 1. Preamble

The most important info before anything else: Espresso is as complicated as you want it to be. In the end Gaggimate gives you alot of Data and Graphs and so on. It can be very tempting to go heavy into all this data and try to read stuff into it. But thats where a big mistake lies. The data you get is just a trend. It can help with a general direction, especially if you know your input parameters like coffee, water and so on. 

But all this data leaves one thing out: coffee is highly subjective! 

The coffee someone else loves, doesn't have to be the right coffee for yourself! And even if you found a graph that tastes perfect for your current beans, as soon as you change the beans, the perfect graph will probably not taste as good as on the beans before. Every coffee is different and thats why its so beautiful.

I can tell you alot about what a nice graph should look like, but every profile is different and what you like will be different then what I like.  
  
While I will try to explain some points graphs and how to read what GM gives you, I will also try to link this to taste and how to change variables more based on taste then what you see on the graph.   
  
The one and only thing you should learn from this document is:

**TASTE IS KING!**

Ignore the Data and focus on taste. Use the data as a rough estimate but not as a rule. If it tastes good to you, all the data is unimportant.
